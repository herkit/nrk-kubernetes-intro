## Clean up

You can always look at the pricing for resources [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/nb-no/pricing/calculator/) and your remaining credits by searching for *Free trial* in the portal.

**Delete your cluster** 

Be careful and only delete the cluster we have made during the workshop ðŸ˜‰ This may take some time

```
az aks delete --name [CLUSTER NAME] --resource-group [RESOURCE GROUP NAME]
```

**Close your billing account**

Follow the steps [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/cancel-azure-subscription) to close your Azure Subscription. 

Verify that everything is closed on [https://dev.azure.com/](https://dev.azure.com/) alo. 


**And that's it! âŽˆ**

And you are done and your credit card will not be charged.
